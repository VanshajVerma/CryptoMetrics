\section{General Information}

\subsection{Purpose}

The purpose of this document is to outline the development team's test plan for the proposed project, CryptoMetrics as per the verification and validation section of the software development cycle. The details pertaining to the test plan includes the automated testing approach, the tools that will be used to conduct tests, and the schedule prioritizing the tests that must take precedence over others.

\subsection{Scope}

The scope of testing includes the tests that will be conducted to verify that the functional and non-functional requirements have been met, the tests prescribed for the Proof of Concept, and the overall Unit-Testing Plan. Since the application being developed is primarily a web application that was created using NextJS, testing will be mostly focused on the ensuring that the features and functionalities respond appropriately to the user's interactions.

\subsection{Overview of Document}
This document will summarize the testing plan for the web-based application CryptoMetrics. It will go over the various testing techniques which will be utilized, for example, manual testing, end-to-end testing and unit testing. This document will also highlight the tests made for the functional and non-functional requirements of the system and would also cover the tests for the PoC. 

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
The software will act as a resource to our targeted audience for looking up more information about their favourite cryptocurrencies. It is a web application where the user can access data on cryptocurrencies regarding its pricing, charts, its performance over a span of time and visuals. The implementation will be done in NextJS. 

\subsection{Test Team}
The test team consists of the existing developers: Himanshu Aggarwal, Saif Fadhel, Vanshaj Verma.

\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
The \texttt{cypress} library will be used to automate most of the frontend tests for this project. The approach is to do mostly automated integration and end-to-end testing to verify if the features are working as expected. The \texttt{cypress} library allows us to mimic "clicks" on a webpage and observe the resulting behavior and changes in the webpage. Using this, we can effectively automate most situations which would otherwise require manual testing.

Apart from this, \texttt{Jest} will be used to do unit testing for some utility methods.

\subsection{Testing Tools}
Majority of integration and end-to-end testing will be done either manually or using the \texttt{cypress} library. Unit testing will be done using \texttt{Jest}.

\subsection{Testing Schedule}
		
See the Gantt Chart \href{https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/webapp/webapp_l02_grp15/-/tree/main/ProjectSchedule}{here}.

\section{Tests for Proof of Concept}

\subsection{Table/Card View Testing}
		
\paragraph{Table and Card View Tests}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{POC-TCV-1}

\textbf{Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The server for the NextJS app is started and the web page is opened.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} The user clicks on the 'Table' icon and then on the time tag to toggle between 24h, last week, and last month, last year.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} The system shall display every cryptocurrencyâ€™s relevant information in a table-like manner based on the interval specified in the time tag. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} This test will be performed manually by running the API calls separately to verify that the information matches what is displayed in the table-view card appropriately.

\item{POC-TCV-2}

\textbf{Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The server for the NextJS app is started and the web page is opened.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} The user clicks on the 'Card' icon and then on the time tag to toggle between 24h, last week, and last month, last year.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} The system shall display every cryptocurrencyâ€™s relevant information in a card-like manner based on the interval specified in the time tag. 
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} This test will be performed manually by running the API calls separately to verify that the information matches what is displayed in the table-view card appropriately.

\end{enumerate}
\newpage	
\subsection{Search Feature Testing}
\begin{enumerate}
\item{POC-SFT-1}


\textbf{Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The server for the NextJS app is started and the web page is opened.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} The user clicks on the search bar and starts typing their expected search term.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} The system shall filter the cards according to the search term entered in the search box and only the cards with matching names would be displayed on the screen.
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} The tests will be performed using the cypress library by comparing the data output of the search filter and comparing it to the expected results. 
\end{enumerate}
	
\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

There have been several changes and new additions separating CryptoMetrics, our project, from Cryptodash, the existing implementation. The existing application primarily displayed a list of cryptocurrencies in tabular form, whereas CryptoMetrics allows users to view this list in both a card view and a table view containing even more columns of information and a mini graph displaying cryptocurrency price changes in the past user specified time. CryptoMetrics also added a product page which allows users to get a detailed view of every cryptocurrency listed in the web app, which was not a part of the existing implementation. Furthermore, the project also adds a page dedicated to comparing cryptocurrencies with one another to indicate changes in projected price increases and decreases to better advise users so they make informed investment decisions. The original implementation did not include any testing within the project's files. Our implementation will be verified rigorously through the use of a test report.
\newpage
\section{Unit Testing Plan}
This project will use the Jest library to do unit testing.	
\subsection{Unit testing of internal functions}
Unit testing will be done on internal utility methods that return a specific output value. These methods will be given specific input values for normal, edge, and boundary cases and the actual and expected outputs will be compared for validation. Unit testing for this application does not require stubs, drivers or coverage metrics. 
		
\subsection{Unit testing of output files}	The application will not be generating any output files. Therefore, there will be no unit testing of output files.

\section{Appendix}

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
